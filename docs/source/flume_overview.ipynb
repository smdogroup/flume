    "# *Flume* Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this file is to outline in detail the use of *Flume* and a workflow for the framework. For a new user, this file will broadly outline the following:\n",
    "- Nomenclature utilized for the framework\n",
    "- Construction of an *Analysis* class, which internally uses *State* objects to define variables and outputs\n",
    "- Defining instances of *Analysis* classes and the role of `sub_analyses` to connect outputs to inputs\n",
    "- Assembly of a *System* with specific instances of *Analysis* classes\n",
    "To address these points, this notebook will provide sections of code with accompanying descriptions regarding the use of the various base classes and how to set up an optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framework Nomenclature\n",
    "Before including any code, it is important to clarify the nomenclature that is used within the framework. All *Analysis* classes contain at least one variable and output, and they may optionally include parameters. In the context of *Flume*, these are defined as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter**: Numerical, boolean, string, or other data type that are nominally set during the construction of an *Analysis* object. Parameters represent one type of inputs to an analysis procedure, but they are not candidates for design variables, as they are set during object construction and are (generally) not changed after this point. Parameters are stored within a dictionary, an attribute of the *Analysis* class entitled `parameters`, where the keys correspond to the parameters' names and the values take on the actual values of the parameters.\n",
    "- **Variable**: Numerical quantities (either floats or NumPy arrays) that are candidates for design variables during optimization. This is the second type of inputs to an analysis procedure and are numerical quantities used to compute outputs of an *Analysis* class. Variables are stored within a dictionary, an attribute of the *Analysis* class entitled `variables`, where the keys correspond to the local variable name and the values are instances of *State* objects. By defining each variable as a *State*, it contains information beyond its numerical value, including the data type, shape, description, derivative, and source. If sub-analyses exist for an *Analysis* class, then variables may be sourced from another object if its local variable name is the same as an output of a connected sub-analysis (see **insert section** for additional details).\n",
    "- **Output**: Outputs are similar in nature to variables, but they are the quantities determined from performing the analysis procedure with a given set of parameters and variables. Output values are also wrapped within *State* objects, so information about an output is accessed in the same way as variables by accessing the `outputs` attribute of an *Analysis* class. As mentioned above, outputs of a sub-analysis can be connected to variables for another *Analysis* class if they share the same local names.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three terms are used throughout the framework but will be further explained in context below. "

Regardless of the purpose of the *Analysis* class, this method must provide an object name `obj_name`, a list of sub-analyses `sub_analyses`, and any keyword arguments `**kwargs`. When constructing a specific instance of this class, the `sub_analyses` list may be empty or contain other *Analysis* objects, but the definition of the `__init__` method does not have to contain this information. \n",

    "```\n",
    "Default parameters must be provided here, as they are one of the required inputs to compute the outputs. If the user wants to override the default parameter values, they are passed in as keyword arguments during object construction. In the event that an *Analysis* class does not have any parameters, the `default_parameters` attribute should be defined as an empty dictionary to denote this. The base class object initialization is then performed by calling\n",

Even if the variable is intended to be sourced from another object, this information is updated on the backend if a connection is identified between an outputs and variables. Finally, the variable *States* are assigned into the `variables` dictionary\n",

    "### `_analyze_adjoint` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparable to the previous method, `_analyze_adjoint` is responsible for propagating the derivatives from the outputs back to the variables. Within *Flume*, the variables for an individual discipline are treated as design variables for the adjoint method. As a result, if the outputs are explicit functions of the input variables, then the user is responsible for computing the partial derivatives of the outputs with respect to the variables and accounting for the impact of the adjoint variables. However, if an *Analysis* internally performs some linear or nonlinear solve to compute additional state variables, the full form of the adjoint method should be used to compute the contributions to the variables' derivatives. A full discussion of the adjoint method is not in the scope of this overview, but its role within *Flume* can be understood through this example. To begin the method, variable and output derivatives are extracted along with the variable values. Similar to values, derivatives are accessed using the `.deriv` extension for *State* objects.\n",

    "Next, since this discipline computes $f$ as an explicit function of $x$ and $y$, the adjoint method simplifies to multiplying the adjoint variables $\\bar{f}$ or `fb` by the partial derivatives of the output with respect to each variable. Note that the addition assignment `+=` operator is used to update, not overwrite, the derivatives for the variables. This is critical to ensure that derivatives already computed for $\\bar{x}$ (`xb`) and $\\bar{y}$ (`yb`) do not get discarded.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Compute contributions to xb\n",
    "xb += (2 * (a - x) * -1 + 2.0 * b * (y - x**2) * -2 * x) * fb\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compute contributions to yb\n",
    "yb += (2 * b * (y - x**2)) * fb\n",
