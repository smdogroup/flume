            String that defines the output directory where the log file and other files are saved, defaults to the current directory '.'
        parallel_execution : bool
            Boolean operator that specifies whether the DAG should be executed in parallel for the forward and adjoint analyses. Defaults to False.
        parallel_max_workers : int
            Only applied when `parallel_execution` is True. Spawns this many threads for performing the forward/adjoint analyses in parallel.

        """
        Private method that builds a decluttered version of the static graphviz visual.

        Compared to ``_static_graph_network``, this version:
          * Groups all variables flowing between the same (source, target) pair
            of analyses into a single edge (no edge labels).
          * Variable names are stored as a tooltip (visible in SVG/HTML output).
          * Enables ``concentrate=True`` so graphviz merges shared edge segments.
          * Renders nodes with rounded corners.
          * Optionally fills nodes with a hex color code.

        Parameters
        ----------
        node_fillcolor : str, optional
            Hex color code (e.g. ``"#AED6F1"``) used to fill non-top-level
            analysis nodes. If ``None``, no fill is applied.
        top_level_fillcolor : str, optional
            Hex color code (e.g. ``"#F1948A"``) used to fill top-level analysis
            nodes. If ``None``, defaults to ``node_fillcolor`` when that is set,
            otherwise no fill is applied.
        opacity : float, optional
            Fill opacity from 0.0 (transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Applied
            to both ``node_fillcolor`` and ``top_level_fillcolor`` by appending
            an alpha byte to the hex color. Defaults to 1.0.
