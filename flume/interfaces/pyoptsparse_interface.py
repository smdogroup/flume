class FlumePyOptSparseInterface:

        """
        Creates an interface that is used to link an instance of a Flume System to an optimization problem constructed and driven through pyOptSparse. To perform the numeric optimization, the user should call the `optimize_system` method after constructing this object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        flume_sys : System
            Instance of a Flume System that represents the problem to be solved with the interface
        callback : callable function, default None
            This is a callable function that gets executed during every iteration of the _objConFun method during optimization. See below for the structure of the function
        update : callable function, default None
            This is a callable function that gets executed at the start of every iteration of the evalObjCon method during optimization. Nominally, this is used to do parameter updates, such as for a continuation strategy

        Note
        ----
        The callback function is an arbitrary function that the user writes, and it will be called at the end of every _objconGradFun execution. It is required that the function is setup such that it takes in two arguments:

        def user_callback(xdict, it_number):
            ...

        Here, the parameters are:
            xdict : dictionary that specifies the current design variable values for the optimization problem
            it_number : current iteration number for the system

        The update function is also a function that the user can optionally provide, and it will be called at the start of every evalObjCon execution. This method is primarily used for updating parameters within the Flume System (e.g. for continuation strategies in topology optimization), and it is structured as follows:

        def user_update(it_number):
            ...

        where it_number is the current iteration number for the system
